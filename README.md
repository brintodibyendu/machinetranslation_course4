# machinetranslation_course4
Recently I have been doing a Coursera natural language specialization course. Right now, I am in the seq2seq course where I am learning about the seq2seq model, attention, transformer, state of art transformer model, including T5, and BERT. They covered all intrinsic topics about beam search, and the minimum bias was reduced to a lot.
